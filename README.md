# Factorial Calculator - C Implementation

A simple **Factorial Calculator** implemented in C. This program allows users to calculate the factorial of a single number or multiple numbers using loops.

## üéÆ How to Use:
1. The program asks whether you want to calculate **a single factorial** or **multiple factorials**.
2. If you choose **single factorial**, enter the number you want to find the factorial of.
3. If you choose **multiple factorials**, enter the number of elements and then input each number.
4. The program calculates and displays the factorial of the given number(s).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- **C Programming**
- **Loops** (for, while)
- **Functions** to calculate factorial
- **Arrays** for handling multiple numbers

## üöÄ Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadBuilds/Basic_factorial_calculator
```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

```bash
cd Basic_factorial_calculator
```

3. **Compile the program using GCC:**

```bash
gcc Basic_factorial_calculator.c -o Basic_factorial_calculator
```

4. **Run the program:**

```bash
./Basic_factorial_calculator
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Algorithm Explanation:
1. **Factorial** of a number `n` is calculated as:
   
   
   **n! = n √ó (n-1) √ó (n-2) √ó ... √ó 1**
   
   Example: `5! = 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 120`
2. The program provides two modes:
   - **Single factorial calculation** using a loop.
   - **Multiple factorial calculations** using an array and loops.
3. The results are displayed for each input.

### Example Output:
```
Enter 1 to calculate single factorial or 2 to calculate multiple factorials: 2
Enter the number of integers: 3
Enter 1st number: 3
Enter 2nd number: 4
Enter 3rd number: 5

The factorial of 3 is 6
The factorial of 4 is 24
The factorial of 5 is 120
```

## üìö What I Learned:
- How to implement **factorial calculation** in C using loops.
- Using **functions** to modularize the code.
- Handling **arrays and user input** effectively.
